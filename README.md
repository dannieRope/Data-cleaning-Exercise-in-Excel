##                                   Data cleaning process
* **Column widths:** I Sorted out the widths of all columns so that the data is clearly visible in all cells.

* **Empty rows:** I Used the Filter feature to look for blanks and remove all empty rows from the data. A total of 5 rows was removed in this process.

* **Duplicate records:** I Used the Remove Duplicates feature to look for and remove any duplicated records from the data. A total of 8 duplicates values were found and removed.

* **Spelling:** The original source file data has not been checked for errors in the spelling. I Checked for spelling mistakes in the data and fix them. During this process 5 words spelt wrongly were fixed.

* **Whitespace:** I Used the Find and Replace feature to remove all double-spaces from the data. 3 replacements were made. I also used the TRIM() to remove single spaces

* **Department names:** When the data was converted from its data source, the department names (see correct list below) didnâ€™t import correctly and they are now splited over two columns in the data. I Used Flash Fill to reduce the department names to just one column, and then remove any unnecessary columns
