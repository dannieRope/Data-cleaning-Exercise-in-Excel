**This exercise is carried out to solidify my data cleaning skill**

The dataset used in this exercise comes from the [here](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr) under a Public Domain license.

These are the columns of the dataset and their data types

##                                   Data cleaning process
* **Column widths:** I Sorted out the widths of all columns so that the data is clearly visible in all cells.

* **Empty rows:** I Used the Filter feature to look for blanks and remove all empty rows from the data. A total of 5 rows was removed in this process.

* **Duplicate records:** I Used either the Conditional Formatting or Remove Duplicates feature to look for and remove any duplicated records from the data.

* **Spelling:** The original source file data has not been checked for errors in the spelling. I Checked for spelling mistakes in the data and fix them.

* **Whitespace:** I Used the Find and Replace feature to remove all double-spaces from the data.

* **Department names:** When the data was converted from its data source, the department names (see correct list below) didnâ€™t import correctly and they are now splited over two columns in the data. I Used Flash Fill to reduce the department names to just one column, and then remove any unnecessary columns
